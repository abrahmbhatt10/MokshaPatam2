| April 5 |      3-8pm       | I decided to delete all my code from attempt 1 and get a clean slate to start approaching this problem while using a Breadth first search, because my previous method of trying to solve the problem used up too much heap space. What I did was I used the google slides pseudocode. Rather than make a Moksha square, I made a Moksha node. I tried to use a queue to create a new node and add it to the existing queue, but that used up too much heap space. |

To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
