|:--------|:--------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| April 4 | 5:00 - 5:30pm  |                                                                           I started tackling the problem. |
| April 4 | 5:30 - 6:00pm  |                                                              I did this by changing by previous approach. |
| April 4 | 6:00 - 6:30pm  |                                                                Unfortunately, not much progress was made. |
| April 4 | 6:30 - 7:00pm  |                                                                 I tried to use a queue to add new nodes . |
| April 4 | 7:00  - 7:30pm |                                                                     I did this for each non-visited node. |
| April 5 |    3-3:30pm    |                                                           I decided to delete all my code from attempt 1. |
| April 5 |    3:30-4pm    |                                                                  I did this so I could get a clean slate. |
| April 5 |    4-4:30pm    |                                    I started approaching this problem while using a Breadth first search. |
| April 5 |   4:30 - 5pm   |         I did this because my previous method of trying to solve the problem used up too much heap space. |
| April 5 |    5-5:30pm    |                                                       What I did was I used the google slides pseudocode. |
| April 5 |    5:30-6pm    |                                                                         Initially I made a moksha square. |
| April 5 |    6-6:30pm    |                                                                              Later, I made a Moksha node. |
| April 5 |    6:30-7pm    |                                                                                   I tried to use a queue. |
| April 5 |    7-7:30pm    |                                                             I did this so that I could create a new node. |
| April 5 |   7:30 - 8pm   |                                                I also realized that I could add it to the existing queue. |
| April 6 |   8-8:30 am    | I realized that rather than creating a new node and adding it to the queue, I could simply use a pointer. |
| April 6 |    8:30-9am    |    I did this to point to the node arraylist.                                                                                                       |
| April 6 |    9-9:30am    |     Rather than use up too much heap space, I did this instead of creating a new node.                                                                                                      |
